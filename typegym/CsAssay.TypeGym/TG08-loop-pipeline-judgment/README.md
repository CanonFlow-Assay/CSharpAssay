# TG08 — Loop-to-pipeline judgment

Primary obligation: Choose a LINQ pipeline for transformation while retaining loops when their control flow is clearer.

`Bad.cs`, `Compat.cs`, and `Native.cs` are compiled independently by the
TypeGym harness. The harness executes `TypeGym.Challenge.Probe()`, compares
the semantic analyzer result with the checked-in expectation, and rejects
compiler errors or analyzer crashes. It does not inspect source substrings.

The native expectation is capability-bounded. Where the current SDK lacks the
qualified native-union surface, `Native.cs` is an executable unavailable-lane
marker rather than invented preview syntax.
